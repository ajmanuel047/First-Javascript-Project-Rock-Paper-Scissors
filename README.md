# First-Javascript-Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors
This is my very first JavaScript Project. With the lessons from Odin Projects I would like to see how I perform here. Am really excited.

After finishing this project I have to say that it was fun but probably took longer than I expected

# Some of the challenges I faced
The project wasn't difficult but the part that was a challenge was creating the game function and making it to work
I also found it quite difficult updating the score board

# How I fixed this challenge
To fix this I called the playRound() function within the game function because without this the loop just dedicates the score of the entire iteration to only one of the variables which was either 5 to playerScore, 5 to computerScore or 5 to drawScore

# What I learnt
The most challenging part in this project for me was the game function. I knew I had to call the playRound function but it did not occur to me that I had to pass in parameters into this function. I battled with this for some time but later figured it out after several researching

# What I intend to later do
When I have gotten better with DOM manipulation I plan to visit this project again and make some adjustments. This time I would make it less of an alert/prompt but rather an interactive UI
